## Preface
This is a small project i decided to work on. I got a skull from the dollar store that had a moving jaw and I thought why not try and motorize it.  I did some searching online and found JawDuino but I wanted to use a Raspberry Pi and Python(*since I'm slowly working on learning python*). 

## Parts

* Raspberry Pi 3
* EMAX ES08A II servo
* Some sort of skull?
* jumper wires, etc

## Schematic

Here is a down & dirty schematic:

## To-Do

Some to-do items for Halloween 2020

* Find a hat that will translate audio file into PWM to better control the jaw
* Add button or proximity sensor to trigger **or** *Idea: Use an ESP8266 hooked to the doorbell to trigger*
* Get better with python
