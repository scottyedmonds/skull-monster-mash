## Preface
This is a small project i decided to work on. I got a skull from the dollar store that had a moving jaw and I thought why not try and motorize it.  I did some searching online and found JawDuino but I wanted to use a Raspberry Pi and Python. 

## Parts

* Raspberry Pi 3
* EMAX ES08A II servo
* Some sort of skull?

## Schematic

Here is a down & dirty schematic:
